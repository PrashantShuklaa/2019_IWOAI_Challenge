# The International Workshop on Osteoarthritis Imaging Knee MRI Segmentation Challenge: A Multi-Institute Evaluation and Analysis Framework on a Standardized Dataset

## Introduction
This repo contains the implementation of the deep learning-based knee MRI cartilage segmentation model used for osteoarthritis research as described in our paper: [The International Workshop on Osteoarthritis Imaging Knee MRI Segmentation Challenge: A Multi-Institute Evaluation and Analysis Framework on a Standardized Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14003). By using this implementation, you can either train new knee MRI cartilage segmentation models or obtain knee MRI cartilage segmentation by using our pretrained model.

## Instructions
1. Please refer to IBM Power machine's "PowerAI 1.6.0" conda environment with the dependencies provided in `requirements.txt`. For Linux machines, please use the `requirements.yml` file to create a Conda environment:  
```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```
2. `./data` folder contains subfolders named `./train`, `./test` , and `./valid` which needs to include train, test and validation set images and segmentation maps, respectively. To request the dataset used for the IWOAI challenge, please contact [Dr. Chaudhari](mailto:akshaysc@stanford.edu). 
3. Once you have data ready, you can use `train.py` to train a segmentation model with predefined settings that were used on model training for submission to the IWOAI challenge. Trained models will be saved within the folder named `./TrainedModels` 
4. Use `inference.py` file to obtain knee MRI cartilage segmentation by using our pretrained model. MR images located inside `./data/test` folder will be used to produce cartilage segmentation maps. 

## Repo Structure
* `./data`: Folder for knee MR images and cartilage segmentation that will be used for training.
* `./InferenceModel`: Trained model weights used in this study. They can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x9ET75IJuL-y64kHOa718PDKu3vTxQ_H/view?usp=sharing).
* `./InferenceResults`: will contain the cartilage segmentation maps when `inference.py` file runs. 
* `./TrainedModels`: will contain trained cartilage segmentation models when `train.py` file runs. 

## Training a DL model
You can use this repo to train models for segmenting the knee MRI cartilage. Default parameters are defined within `train.py` file. So, you directly run the following script to train a DL model. 
```bash
python train.py
```
Please see the arguments in the .py file to make input argument changes if you need. 

## Inference
Once you download pretrained model weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x9ET75IJuL-y64kHOa718PDKu3vTxQ_H/view) to the `./InferenceModel` folder, you can use the following script to obtain cartilage segmentation of knee MR images located under `./data/test`:
```bash
python inference.py 
```
## Computer System
We used an HPC system with multiple IBM Witherspoon GPU nodes, each node has multiple IBM Power9 4Ghz Processors and V100 NVLink (Volta) GPUâ€™s, and a 512GB RAM. In this project, we used TensorFlow v1.13.1 with a single Nvidia Tesla V100 32GB RAM GPU.
